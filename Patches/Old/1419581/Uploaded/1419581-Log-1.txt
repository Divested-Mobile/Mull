Lets start?

The builds below have the above patch (8930711) applied.

Build [1] here is built with just "MOZ_NATIVE_DEVICES=", it fails.
RemotePresentationService.java and PresentationMediaPlayerManager.java are properly specified in base/moz.build.
However they are not excluded in app/build.gradle, so it still gets included.

Build [2] here is built with the following and it fails:
MOZ_ANDROID_GCM=
MOZ_NATIVE_DEVICES=
MOZ_INSTALL_TRACKING=
MOZ_ANDROID_MMA=

MmaDelegate.java appears to be deeply tied into various components and cannot be easily removed, but it should not need to be removed as there is MmaStubImp.java.
The issue is that Push is in MmaDelegate, where as it should be instead handled in MmaLeanplumImp.java.
The offending line 76 "mmaHelper.setGcmSenderId(PushManager.getSenderIds());" can be moved into MmaLeanplumImp.java.

Build [3] has the same config as build [2], it fails.
The issue is a missing drawable, I think this is an unreleated issue.

Okay so the issue from build [3] is not unrelated.
The missing drawable "ic_close_light" is part of android/support/v7/mediarouter.
Mediarouter is not included when MOZ_NATIVE_DEVICES=0
"ic_close_light" is just an 'X', we can replace it with "android.R.drawable.ic_menu_close_clear_cancel" for now.

Build [4] now compiles successfully.
The resulting APK *does not* contain GMS.
